#MVC - Model View Controller 

##Model
- handles business logic
- handles database
- makes database queries
- makes database values as manageable objects

##Controller
- acts as a communicator between Model and View
- handles program logics

##View
- handles UI
- handles requests from user
- sends requests to Controller
- receives the sent requests from Controller

##This is purely based on my understanding.
